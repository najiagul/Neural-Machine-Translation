# Neural-Machine-Translation
This is the first porject of week 4 the in course 5 Sequence Models from the deeplearning.ai specialization.

I have built a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25").
I have done this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models.
